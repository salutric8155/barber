	    	<p>Craig the Barber is Hollywood’s top source for men’s grooming needs, a role he has held for more than 10 years. But the true story is that Craig unknowingly began his journey toward becoming a master barber all the way back at the age of 14 years-old. Like many high school students, he valued his personal style a bit higher than his parents (meaning he thought getting a fresh haircut each week was perfectly acceptable while they didn’t quite see things that way!) and began to teach himself how to cut hair in order to achieve his desired style.</p>
